# DigDeep

DigDeep will dig up a value in a nested hash by the key. It will recursively dig each nested object until the first matching key/value is found.

Ruby's dig method can accomplish the same thing, but you need to specify the path to the target key.

With this gem, you will only need to specify the target key and it will do the digging.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dig-deep'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dig-deep

## Usage
You will need a hash object and the key name.

```
data = {
  :l1 => {
    :l2 => {
      :l3 => {
        :l4a => "Level 4",
        :l4b => {
          :l5a => false,
          :l5b => {
            :l6 => ["apple", "orange"]
          }
        } 
      }
    }
  },
  :l7 => true
}
```

```data.dig_deep(:l4a)  // "Level 4"```

```data.dig_deep(:l5a)  // false```

```data.dig_deep(:xyz)  // nil```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rspec spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
